**Last Updated: December 19, 2025**

## Overview

NumberLocks ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information in our puzzle game.

## Data Collection

We collect anonymous usage analytics to improve the game experience. This data is collected through Firebase Analytics and is NOT linked to your identity.

### Analytics Data Collected:
- **Game interactions**: Which levels you play, completion rates, moves made, stars earned
- **Vault unlocks**: When you unlock new level sets
- **Tutorial progress**: Whether you've completed the tutorial
- **App usage**: When you launch the app, which features you use
- **Performance data**: App crashes, loading times, technical diagnostics

### What We DON'T Collect:
- ❌ No personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- ❌ No device identifiers (IDFA, advertising ID)
- ❌ No location data
- ❌ No contacts or photos
- ❌ No data linked to your identity
- ❌ No cross-app or cross-website tracking

All analytics data is **anonymous** and used solely to understand how players interact with the game so we can make improvements.

## Local Data Storage

The app stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

### Game Progress

This data never leaves your device and is stored using platform-standard secure storage mechanisms (iOS UserDefaults/Keychain).

- Clearing the app's data through your device settings

Analytics data is anonymous and cannot be deleted individually as it's not linked to your identity.
